<h1><u>Greek Gods/Godesses</u></h1>
<p class="blonde"><b>The ancient Greeks had a particular set of beliefs <br> that helped them to understand themselves and the world around them, <br> and they believed in a variety <br> of gods and goddesses. <br> Each Greek god and goddess stood for something, <br> and the ancient Greeks would worship <br> specific gods for different reasons. <br> There were twelve gods and goddesses that ruled the universe from Mount Olympus, in Greece.</b></p>
<p class="kiwi"><b><u>Here are the top 3 gods and godesses:</u></b></p>
<p class="peanut"><b><u>#1 Zeus.</u></b></p>
<p class="timbit"><b>Zeus, Greek god of the sky and king of Olympus. <br> Son of the Titans Cronus and Rhea.<br> Zeus was regarded as the sender of thunder and lightning, rain, and winds, <br> and his traditional weapon was the thunderbolt.<br> He was called the father (the ruler and protector) <br> of both gods and men. <br> He was also the chief deity of the pantheon</b></p>
<p class="nutella"><b><u>#2 Poseidon.</u></b></p>
<p class="sand"><b> Poseidon, in ancient Greek religion, god of the sea (and of water generally), earthquakes, and horses. <br> He is distinguished from Pontus, the personification of the sea <br> and the oldest Greek divinity of the waters. <br> The name Poseidon means either “husband of the earth” or “lord of the earth."</b></p>
<p class="ketchup"><b><u>#3 Artemis.</u></b></p>
<p class="pink"><b>Artemis, the goddess of chastity, <br> hunting, and the moon, <br> often depicted with <br> her trusty bow and arrow <br> and a short tunic <br> to aid in running through the woods. <br> Her maidenly virtue—<br> for she swore never to marry— <br> was presented in counterpoint <br> to the passionate and fiery Aphrodite.</b></p>
