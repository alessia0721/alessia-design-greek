<h1><u>Myths/stories</u></h1>
<p class="blonde"><b>Greek Mythology holds thousands and thousands <br> of the most iconic myths and stories ever told. Greek Mythology wouldn't <br> be the same without these tales.</b></p>
<p class="kiwi"><b><u>Here are the top 3 myths/stories:</u></b></p>
<p class="peanut"><b><u>#2: Story of Cronus.</u></b></p>
<p class="dove"><b>  Cronus was the ruling Titan who came to power <br> by castrating his Father Uranus. <br> His wife was Rhea. <br> There offspring were the first of the Olympians. <br> To insure his safety Cronus <br> ate each of the children as they were born. <br> This worked until Rhea, <br> unhappy at the loss of her children, <br> tricked Cronus into swallowing a rock, <br> instead of Zeus. When he grew up Zeus would revolt <br> against Cronus and the other Titans, <br> defeat them, and banish them <br> to Tartarus in the underworld.</b></p>
