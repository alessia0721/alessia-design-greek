<th class="banana">My name is Alessia Matrisciano. <br> I am an IB student at St Thomas High School in secondary 3 who decided to take coding class. <br> This is my second year coding and although I am farely familiar  with design coding, <br> I still have a lot to improve on but with the help and guidance of doing this project making this website, <br> it's improving my knowledge to code! <br> In secondary 1, <br> my english class spent a good few months on the topic of greek mythology <br> and I became emmidiately interested and fasinated  by greek mythology and the liberty to expand what I knew on it, <br> so I would say I have so experts in this topic.</th>
